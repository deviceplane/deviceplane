Deviceplane is an open source device management tool for embedded systems and edge computing. It solves various infrastructure problems related to remote device management such as:

- Network connectivity and SSH access
- Orchestration and deployment of remote updates
- Host and application monitoring
- Device organization: naming, labeling, searching, and filtering of devices
- Access and security controls

Deviceplane integrates with your device by running a lightweight static binary via your system supervisor. It can be used with nearly any Linux distro, which means you can continue using Ubuntu, Raspbian, a Yocto build, or whatever else fits your needs.

A hosted version of Deviceplane is available at [https://cloud.deviceplane.com/](https://cloud.deviceplane.com/).

## Documentation

Visit <a aria-label="next.js learn" href="https://deviceplane.com/docs">https://deviceplane.com/docs</a> to view the full documentation.

## Getting Started

The architecture of Deviceplane is simple and designed to be easy to run and manage. The backend can be run with a single Docker command:

```
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 deviceplane/deviceplane
```

For more information on hosting Deviceplane yourself, check out the [self-hosted docs](https://deviceplane.com/docs/self-hosted/).

## Local Development

#### Setup the database

This command will reset the database to an empty state and then seed it with some basic data.

```
make db-reset
```

#### Run the controller

This command starts the controller running on port 8080 by default.

```
go run cmd/controller/main.go --allowed-origin "http://localhost:3000"
```

#### Run the web application

Run the following commands in the `ui/` directory

```
npm install
npm start
```

The login is `email@example.com` / `password`.

#### Run the agent

Navigate to the `/devices/register` route in the web application. A command to run the agent locally will be generated and printed to the browser console.
